2) LocationManager vs Google Play Services(FusedLocationProviderClient)
Answer--- https://stackoverflow.com/questions/33022662/android-locationmanager-vs-google-play-services
--------------
LocationManager - Context.getSystemService(Context.LOCATION_SERVICE)

ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION - provide less accurate location(city block) but faster and does not drain a battery so much

NETWORK_PROVIDER - uses cell towers, wifi access points
PASSIVE_PROVIDER - subscribes on location updates when somebody else in the system uses another providers
ACCESS_FINE_LOCATION - provides better and accurate location(up to few meters). Uses the same providers as ACCESS_COARSE_LOCATION

GPS_PROVIDER - satellites are used
Google API Location Services - GoogleApiClient based on Google Play Services. High level API with access to location events which go through the system. It has better battery performance but could not be installed on some devices

Fused Location Provider - automatically select an appropriate provider based on your needs and device conditions


usedLocationProviderClient

For the 1st fetch, the location must not be null(i.e: Some other app need to update the Lastknown location in the GoogleplayService database. if it is null, need work around)
For the next sequential Fetch, it uses requestLocationUpdates() method to fetch the location.
The location fetch is only based on locationRequest.setInterval(milliseconds)and setFastestInterval(milliseconds), not based on user location change
The LatLng value returned has contain only 7 decimal values (e.g: 11.9557996, 79.8234599), not as accurate
Recommended, when your app requirement takes current location distance negligible of (50 - 100 meters accuracy)
Effective in Battery usage.
LocationManager Api

The user location fetch is invoked using locationManager.requestLocationUpdates()
The location fetch based on user location change and time intervals locationManager.requestLocationUpdates(LocationManager.GPS_PROVIDER, milliseconds, mindistance, Mylocationlistener)

The LatLng value returned has contain 14 decimal values (e.g: 11.94574594963342 79.81166719458997) accurate location values

Recommended for location based app, when needs more accuracy even in meters.
Battery usage is based on fetch interval and fetch distance.
