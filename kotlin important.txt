1) Null safety
https://medium.com/@ChindaVibhor/null-safety-in-kotlin-ecaa67a6b397

The basic difference between the Safe call and Null check is that we use Null checks (!!) only when we are confident that the property canâ€™t have a null value. 
And if we are not sure that the value of the property is null or not then we prefer to use Safe calls(?.).
