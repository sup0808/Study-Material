1.) distinct() and distinctBy() on list
https://stackoverflow.com/questions/65361371/what-does-this-distinctby-method

As you can see, filter will not give you an unique list. You can do that by calling toSet() 
on your list before the filter (and it will still be a List after the filter). Or by calling distinct() after the filter. The distinct() will actually just 
create a Set and turn it back on into a List, so I'd suggest to just use toSet() before the filter.
